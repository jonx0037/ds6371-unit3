# DS 6371 - Unit 3: Statistical Foundations for Data Science

This repository serves as my digital garden for data science knowledge, specifically focusing on Unit 3 of DS 6371 (Statistical Foundations for Data Science) at Southern Methodist University. The content will evolve as I progress through the course assignments and compile my notes.

## Future Development

This repository will include a React application that will serve as a comprehensive collection of my compiled notes and insights from the unit. The app will make the statistical concepts and their applications more accessible and interactive.

## Course Materials

Currently contains materials and assignments related to statistical assumptions and their applications in data science.
